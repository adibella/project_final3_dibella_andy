##Custom Javascript, jQuery and Plug-In Explanations

* **Custom Javascript:** When the alien in the header is clicked, it is replaced with the content "You will love Pizza Planet!"

* **Custom jQuery:** This is pretty simple as I couldn't really think of anything I wanted to add in terms of design using just jQuery. I ended up adding a mouse enter/mouse leave effect over the h4 elements that turn the text from blue to black.

* **[ScrollUp](https://markgoodyear.com/2013/01/scrollup-jquery-plugin/)** I wanted this site to be in a single-scroll format since I haven't done many of those. I spent a good deal of time trying to get a smooth scroll plug-in to aide with the navigation. I wasn't able to make it work the way I wanted to so I ended up using the ScrollUp plug-in as an alternative. It appears at the bottom of the page as you scroll down the site and when clicked it takes the user back to the navigation bar at the top of the site.

* **[Backstretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/)** This plug-in was applied to the background image on the page. In the past I've used hero-images as backgrounds quite often through CSS and for this project I wanted to try to use the jQuery method we learned about in class.

##Comments
The actual coding of the site itself went pretty smoothly. As of this writing the only issue I'm having is some sizing issues with the menu.

I wanted the overall brand and aesthetic of the site to be one of both elegance and kid-friendly. I feel that this was overall achieved.

I also didn't see the extra credit options until the day before it was due so unfortunately I didn't attempt to take advantage of it.

Thank you again for your feedback and efforts!
