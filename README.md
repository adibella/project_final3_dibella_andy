##Resources Used
*  [nth Child](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) This gave some insight into some possible ways to solve a floating issue I had, but I wasn't able to get it to work properly.
*  I was able to piece together everything else from lectures and notes.

##Custom Javascript, jQuery and Plug-In Explanations

* **Custom Javascript:** When the alien in the header is clicked, it is replaced with the content "You will love Pizza Planet!"

* **Custom jQuery:** This is pretty simple. I created a mouseover effect on the social media icons on the bottom of the contact page. When you mouseover it, the icon gets smaller and has a black background.

* **[ScrollUp](https://markgoodyear.com/2013/01/scrollup-jquery-plugin/)** I wanted this site to be in a single-scroll format since I haven't done many of those. I spent a good deal of time trying to get a smooth scroll plug-in to aide with the navigation. I wasn't able to make it work the way I wanted to so I ended up using the ScrollUp plug-in as an alternative. It appears at the bottom of the page as you scroll down the site and when clicked it takes the user back to the navigation bar at the top of the site.

* **[Backstretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/)** This plug-in was applied to the background image on the page. In the past I've used hero-images as backgrounds quite often through CSS and for this project I wanted to try to use the jQuery method we learned about in class.

##Comments
The actual coding of the site itself went pretty smoothly. As of this writing the only issue I'm having is some sizing issues with the menu.

I wanted the overall brand and aesthetic of the site to be one of both elegance and kid-friendly. I feel that this was overall achieved.

I wasn't able to figure out the sizing issue I had with my floats on my menu before I had to submit the project. Thanks for your suggestion during the presentation, but if you could take a close look at what's going on there I'd appreciate it. I ended up being able to make it work by triming down the descriptions in the menu.

Thank you again for your feedback and efforts!
